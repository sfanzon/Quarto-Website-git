## Needs review

- `_pages/blog.md`: old posts are a later audit slice; the current `/blog/` route exists but is not confirmed as migrated Silvio-specific content.
- `_pages/cv_old.md`: decide whether the historic `/Silvio_Fanzon_CV.pdf` route should remain available or be retired in favour of the academic CV download.

## Next audit slice

Collections and assets remain unreviewed: projects; posts/news; teaching, presentation and supervision source records if separate; PDFs/downloads; and images/assets.
